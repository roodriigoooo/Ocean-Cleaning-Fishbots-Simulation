# Ocean-Cleaning-Fishbots-Simulation

Model and simulate the efficiency of autonomous fishbots in cleaning a predefined ocean grid area. The simulation assesses how quickly fishbots can clean a certain percentage of the ocean grid, influenced by the number of fishbots, their movement strategies, and the grid's dimensions. Visualization functions are included to illustrate the performance differences between standard movement strategies and random walks.

### Usage
To run a simulation or generate a plot, call the appropriate function in the if __name__ == "__main__" block at the end of the script. Hereâ€™s how you might call a function to simulate and visualize:

```python
num_fishbots = 5
speed = 1.0
width = 20
height = 20
min_coverage = 0.8
num_trials = 30
fishbot_type = StandardFishbot
visualize = False

# Run a simulation
avg_cleaning_times = runSimulation(num_fishbots, speed, width, height, min_coverage, num_trials, fishbot_type, visualize)

# Generate a plot
showPlot1("Efficiency of Fishbots", "Number of Fishbots", "Time-steps to Clean 80% of Grid")
```
