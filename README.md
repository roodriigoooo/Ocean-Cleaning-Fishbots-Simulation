# Ocean-Cleaning-Fishbots-Simulation
This Python program simulates cleaning tasks in ocean grids using autonomous fishbots. The program models fishbots with different movement strategies in various grid configurations to determine the efficiency of cleaning operations. It includes visualization capabilities to compare performance metrics across different scenarios.
